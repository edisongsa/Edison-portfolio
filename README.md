PROJECT 1
Impact of El Niño Events on Wildfires: A Data Analysis Study

Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze the impact of El Niño events on the occurrence and severity of wildfires. El Niño is a climate phenomenon characterized by warming of the ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. It is known to influence weather patterns worldwide, potentially affecting wildfire conditions. By analyzing historical wildfire data in conjunction with El Niño index data, this study aims to determine if there is a significant increase in the number of wildfires during El Niño years.

Data Collection
Two datasets will be used for this analysis:

Wildfire Data: The dataset contains information on the number of fires and acres burned from 1983 to 2022. It includes variables such as the year, number of fires, and acres burned.
El Niño Index Data: The dataset includes information on El Niño events, including the year, start ONI value, starting season, peak ONI value, and peak season. The ONI (Oceanic Niño Index) is a measure of the departure from average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific.
##Data Analysis
The analysis will involve the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The wildfire and El Niño index datasets will be loaded into R and prepared for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and merging the datasets based on the common year column.
Statistical Testing: A t-test will be conducted to compare the number of fires during El Niño years and non-El Niño years. The t-test will evaluate whether there is a significant difference in the number of fires between these two groups.
Interpretation of Results: The t-test results will be analyzed, and conclusions will be drawn based on the significance level (e.g., 0.05). If the p-value is below the significance level, it suggests a significant increase in the number of fires during El Niño events.

Expected Outcome
The project aims to determine whether there is a statistically significant association between El Niño events and an increase in wildfires. The findings will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between climate patterns and wildfire occurrences. If a significant association is identified, it may have implications for wildfire management and preparedness during El Niño years.

Limitations and Future Scope
It is important to acknowledge that this analysis has certain limitations. The study focuses on the number of fires and does not consider other factors that may influence wildfire occurrences, such as human activity or local environmental conditions. Additionally, the analysis is based on historical data, and future climate patterns and their potential impact on wildfires may differ. Future research could incorporate additional variables and consider a more comprehensive analysis of wildfire dynamics.

By conducting this data analysis, we aim to gain insights into the relationship between El Niño events and wildfire occurrences. The results of this study can contribute to scientific understanding and inform strategies for wildfire prevention, preparedness, and response during El Niño years.
